# Exploring Python and Computer Science

This repository is a personal journey through Python and the fundamentals of computer science. As someone aiming to become a proficient software engineer, I'm revisiting the basics, practicing syntax, and diving deep into computer science concepts to enhance my understanding and capabilities in writing optimised and quality code.

## Progress Log

- **Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition**: Started with revising Python syntax and fundamentals. This book serves as a refresher and a solid foundation to ensure I'm comfortable with Python programming. It's an essential step in my journey to mastering Python and preparing for more advanced topics in computer science. Completed this book in 2 days.

- **Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science by John Zelle**: The next step in my journey is to solidify my understanding of computer science and data structures & algorithms (DSA). This book is crucial for grounding my knowledge in computer science principles, which is vital for my goal of becoming a proficient backend engineer.

This journey is not just about learning Python but about understanding the principles of computer science that will enable me to tackle complex problems and optimise code for better performance.
